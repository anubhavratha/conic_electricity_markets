## Setup:
A chance-constrained conic electricity market clearing problem solved as a central planner problem. Further details on the model parameters and the reformulation of the chance constraints can be found in the manuscript.The figure below shows the energy prices at various nodes of the 24-bus electricity system considered in the case study.
